# Privacy Policy for TaskSpan

**Effective Date: February 14, 2026**  
**Last Updated: February 14, 2026**

## 1. Overview

TaskSpan is designed for personal time tracking with a privacy-first approach. We do not require account registration to use core features.

## 2. Data We Collect

TaskSpan does not collect personal data on our servers for core app usage.

Data you create in the app (task names, tags, time entries) is stored locally on your device.

## 3. How Data Is Used

Your data is used only to provide app features:

- Timer tracking and history
- Daily and weekly summaries
- Filtering and CSV export

## 4. Data Sharing

We do not sell or share your personal data with third parties.

If you export CSV files, you control where those files are sent or stored.

## 5. Third-Party Services

TaskSpan core tracking features do not rely on third-party analytics or ad networks.

Platform providers (Apple, Google) may process technical and billing data under their own policies.

## 6. Data Retention and Deletion

You can delete entries directly in the app.  
Deleting the app removes local app data from your device, subject to your device backup settings.

## 7. Contact

For privacy questions, contact [contact@borysonline.com](mailto:contact@borysonline.com?subject=TaskSpan%20Privacy).
